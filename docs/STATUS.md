## 📊 Priority

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. **deployment/vercel.md** - Critical for deployment
2. **deployment/environment.md** - Critical for configuration
3. **platforms/adding-platforms.md** - Core extensibility feature
4. **api/endpoints.md** - API reference

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
5. **deployment/workers.md** - For transcription feature
6. **deployment/docker.md** - Alternative deployment

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
7. Platform-specific docs (twitter.md, reddit.md) - Can be added as implemented
8. Development docs - Can reference existing quick-start.md
9. API auth/error docs - Can be part of endpoints.md

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Production Ready (Create High Priority Only)
Focus on deployment and API docs needed for first release:
1. deployment/vercel.md
2. deployment/environment.md
3. platforms/adding-platforms.md
4. api/endpoints.md

### Option 2: Complete Core Docs (Create High + Medium)
Add worker deployment for full feature set:
5. deployment/workers.md
6. deployment/docker.md

### Option 3: Full Documentation (Create All)
Complete all documentation including optional dev guides.

## ✅ Verification Results

### No Issues Found:
- ✅ No duplicate files
- ✅ No misplaced files
- ✅ All existing files are properly organized
- ✅ All existing files have proper navigation
- ✅ Cross-references in existing files are valid

### Links Status:
- ✅ docs/README.md references all planned files (including missing ones)
- ⚠️ Some links point to files that don't exist yet (marked as planned)
- ✅ All existing files link back to docs/README.md correctly

## 📝 Documentation Quality Checklist

All completed files include:
- ✅ Title and description
- ✅ Navigation links (back to index)
- ✅ Table of contents
- ✅ Code examples
- ✅ Related documentation section
- ✅ Last updated date
- ✅ Proper formatting

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Claude Code AI Instructions
**CLAUDE.md** has been updated with instructions to:
- ✅ Always research official tech docs before implementing
- ✅ Keep local documentation up-to-date with code changes
- ✅ Update docs immediately when code changes
- ✅ Verify code examples match actual implementation
- ✅ Never defer documentation updates

### For Developers
When adding code:
1. Research official docs for best practices
2. Read relevant local docs before implementing
3. Update ALL affected documentation files
4. Verify code examples in docs match implementation
5. Update environment.md if adding new env vars
6. Update api/endpoints.md if adding new routes

---

**Recommendation**: Create high-priority docs (vercel, environment, adding-platforms, endpoints) before first deployment.
