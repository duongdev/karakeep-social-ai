## 🛠️ Test Utilities

### Database Helpers

```typescript
import { testPrisma, cleanDatabase, seedTestData } from '../helpers/test-db.js'

// Clean database before tests
await cleanDatabase()

// Seed test data
const fixtures = await seedTestData()
```

### HTTP Testing Helpers

```typescript
import { testEndpoint, expectSuccess, expectError } from '../helpers/test-server.js'

// Test an endpoint
const res = await testEndpoint(app, 'GET', '/health')

// Assert success
const data = expectSuccess(res)

// Assert error
const error = expectError(res, 404)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. Use `npm run test:watch` during development
2. Run `npm run test:coverage` before commits
3. Keep tests fast by mocking external APIs
4. Clean database between tests for isolation
5. Use descriptive test names
6. Test both happy paths and edge cases
